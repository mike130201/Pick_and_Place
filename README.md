## Procedure to calculate the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters

In order to obtain the kinematic analysis of the Robot, it is required to obtain the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters, this by means of the fifteen steps.
In order to obtain the kinematic analysis of the robot, it is required to obtain the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters, this by means of the fifteen steps, nevertheless, the most important thing is to consider which is the position 0 of the robot, in the following image we can see how the OPENMANIPULATOR X is the position 0.

As this is the expected configuration, we started to elaborate each of the steps to obtain the parameters.
parameters.

1. Number the links: "0" will be called the "ground", or fixed base where the robot is anchored. "1" the first
first mobile link, etc. 0-1-2-3 Links.

2.Number the joints: "1" will be the first degree of freedom, and "n" the last. 1-4 Articulations

3. Locate the axis of each joint: For pairs of revolution, it will be the axis of rotation. For prismatic, it will be the axis along which the link moves.

4. Z axes: We start placing the XYZ systems. We place the Zi-1 on the axes of the i joints, with i = 1, . . . ., n. That is, Z0 goes on the axis of the 1st joint, Z1 goes on the axis of the 2nd degree of freedom, etc.

5. Coordinate system 0: The origin point is located at any point along Z0. The orientation of X0 and Y0 can be arbitrary, provided of course that XYZ is a dextrorotating system.
6. Rest of systems: For the rest of the systems i = 1, . . . ., N - 1, place the origin point at the intersection of Zi with the normal common to Zi and Zi+1. intersection of Zi with the normal common to Zi and Zi+1. In case the two Z axes intersect, place it at that point of intersection. In case they are parallel, place it in some point of the i + 1 joint.

7. X-axis Each Xi goes in the direction of the normal common to Zi-1 and Zi, in the direction from Zi-1 to Zi. to Zi.
8. Y axes: Once the Z and X axes are located, the Y axes have their directions determined by the constraint of forming a dextrorotating XYZ. constraint of forming a dextrorotating XYZ.
9. Robot end system: The n-th XYZ system is placed at the robot end (tool), with its Z axis (tool), with its Z-axis parallel to Zn-1 and X and Y in any valid direction.

10. Angles Œ∏: Each Œ∏i is the angle from Xi-1 to Xi revolving around Zi.

Œò1=-180¬∞ & 180¬∞
Œò2=-180¬∞ & 180¬∞
Œò3=-180¬∞ & 180¬∞
Œò4=-180¬∞ & 180¬∞

11. Distances d: Each di is the distance from the XY system Zi-1 to the intersection of the common normals of Zi-1 towards Zi , along Zi-1 . common normals from Zi-1 to Zi , along Zi-1.

d1 = 0.77 mm
d2 =0.128 mm
d3 =0mm
d4 =0mm

12. Distances a: Each ai is the length of such common normal.

a1=0mm
a2=0.024mm
a3=0.124mm
a4=0.126mm

13. Angles ' Œ±: Angle to rotate ' Zi-1 to reach Zi, rotating around Xi.

ùõº1=pi/2
ùõº2=0
ùõº3=0

## Obtaining and validation of the Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics using Matlab.

Made the DH parameters, it is possible to obtain the direct and inverse kinematics of the robot, this will be done using the Matlab software, in conjunction with Peter Corke's "Robotics Toolbox" plugin, by obtaining and validating both kinematics we can obtain the kinematic analysis of the robot.

In general, the procedure consists of generating the robot in Matlab, giving the specifications of the measurements and types of the joints, as well as the rotation that they have, that is, substituting the values in the DH matrix, which remains in the following way:

(IMAGEN DE DH CON VALORES)

Using the ".teach" command, the graphical interface of the robot is printed, which is as follows:

(IMAGEN DL ROBOT EN MATLAB)

The direct kinematics is obtained by calculating through the analysis of each of the joints, to later obtain the analysis of the entire robot by multiplying the results of all the joints, the procedure for each joint is as follows:

(IMAGE OF THE GENERAL PROC OF THE CD)

Therefore, it is enough to substitute the values ‚Äã‚Äãin each of the operations, said values ‚Äã‚Äãare the same as those of the DH table, this applies to all the joints of our robot, with which it only remains to multiply the analyzes of the different joints. To know that the calculation is correct, the values of the matrix obtained are compared with the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the simulation, as observed below:

(Image of the robot and the CD)

Since the values are the same, the calculation is correct.

To obtain the inverse kinematics, a complex analysis must be carried out for each joint, in which the procedure differs depending on the characteristics of each one, so using the Robotics Toolbox plugin, the ".ikine" command can be used, which performs the calculation in the position that we assign, the result is shown below:

(IMAGEN DE LA CI CON EL ROBOT)

With both kinematics validated, we proceed to use Ross and Gazebo.
